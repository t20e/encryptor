# Notes on Make commands
# 	`:=` is the simple expansion, the variable is evaluated only once, at the very first occurrence.
# 	`=` is the recursive expansion, the value of the variable is evaluated every time it's used. This has downsides!
# 	`@` tells `make` to execute the command after it silently, so make doesn't print the command its about to run,.


# Assign variable `CXX` to the clang++ compiler
CXX = clang++ 

# Assign CXXFLAGS variable that defines compiler flags
# `-Wall` enable all compiler warnings
# The `-MMD` and `-MP` Generate dependency (.d) files for header tracking . When you modify a header file, 'make' will know to recompile the source files that include that header file.
CXXFLAGS = -std=c++23 -Wall -MMD -MP
